        Check out the [linear algebra recap](flow:001-linalg-recap). Do it now. Do it.

        You can also go there using a
        <a href="flow:001-linalg-recap" role="button" class="btn btn-primary">Bootstrap button</a>.

        You can also jump directly to the [sample quiz](flow:quiz-test).

        Look at the amazing embedded [PDF](repocur:pdfs/sample.pdf).

        In addition to interactive content, RELATE also supports [static (i.e.
        non-interactive) pages](staticpage:test).

        Remember, this image shows the model that RELATE is trying to put out
        of business:

          (Note that all of this is sample content. RELATE does not clutter
          your course page with information about itself.)

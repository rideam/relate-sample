## Laws of Indices 
---

Indices provide an easier way of expressing large numbers. An index is a power to a given base.

For example instead of writing $2 \times 2 \times 2$ we can write: $2^3$

Where:

- $2$ - base 
- $3$ - index or power


### Law 1:  $\quad a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$
---
When multiplying numbers in the same base the base is maintained and the powers are added.


#### Examples

{% from "content-macros.jinja" import qtn %}
{{ qtn("What is the capital of France", "Paris", "qn1") }}
